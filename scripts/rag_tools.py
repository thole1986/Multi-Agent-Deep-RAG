    Search historical financial documents (SEC filings: 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K) using hybrid search.

    **IMPORTANT: This is the PRIMARY tool for financial research.**
    **ALWAYS call this tool FIRST for ANY financial question unless:**
    - User explicitly asks for "current", "live", "real-time", or "latest" market data
    - User asks about current stock prices or today's market information

    This tool searches through:
    - Historical SEC filings (10-K annual reports, 10-Q quarterly reports)
    - Financial statements, revenue, expenses, cash flow data
    - Company performance metrics from past quarters and years
    - Automatically extracts filters (company, year, quarter, doc type) from your query

    Use this for queries about:
    - Historical revenue, profit, expenses ("What was Amazon's revenue in Q1 2024?")
    - Year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter comparisons
    - Financial metrics from SEC filings
    - Any historical financial data

    Args:
        query: Natural language search query (e.g., "Amazon Q1 2024 revenue")

    Use this tool after each search to analyze results and plan next steps systematically.
    This creates a deliberate pause in the research workflow for quality decision-making.

    When to use:
    - After receiving search results: What key information did I find?
    - Before deciding next steps: Do I have enough to answer comprehensively?
    - When assessing research gaps: What specific information am I still missing?
    - Before concluding research: Can I provide a complete answer now?

    Reflection should address:
    1. Analysis of current findings - What concrete information have I gathered?
    2. Gap assessment - What crucial information is still missing?
    3. Quality evaluation - Do I have sufficient evidence/examples for a good answer?
    4. Strategic decision - Should I continue searching or provide my answer?

    Args:
        reflection: Your detailed reflection on research progress, findings, gaps, and next steps

    Returns:
        Confirmation that reflection was recorded for decision-making
